Title: An R Package to aggregate Panel Data
Description: The term panel data refers to a type of dataset which contains
    multiple variables measured over time. Panel datasets occur in fields of
    research that do longitudinal studies. Business cycle researchers for
    example conduct regular surveys among the same set of firms to draw
    intertemporal comparison and infer on the business cycle. Often one or
    multiple dimensions of the panel dataset are collapsed by aggregation
    during the analysis. Typically observations are summarized by computing
    means or shares over certain groups. Assume a set of firms is summarized to
    different sectors of trade: e.g. lots of firms belonging to the service
    sector are aggregated to a mean number of employees in the service sector
    over time. This package provides useful functions to aggregate panel data
    and convert aggregation results into standard R time series. The
    panelaggregation package relies on the data.table and can be regarded as a
    more intuitive convenience layer around data.table.
